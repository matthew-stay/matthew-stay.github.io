1 14 Oz. Can of Tomatoes (do you have fresh tomatoes? Great! Use them and 1 TB of tomato paste instead)
3 Cloves of minced garlic
Small handful of basil
1/4 Cup finely grated parmeggiano-reggiano (a bit untraditional)
1 Teaspoon of dried oregano
1 Tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil
1/2 Teaspoon of sugar
Salt/Pepper to taste

Combine the ingredients (all, except for only 1/2 of the basil) and cook over a medium heat for approximately one hour. You should then be able to crush the tomatoes using a wooden spoon against the side of the pan. Blend or drop in a food processor if you prefer a super smooth consistency.  Finish with achiffonade of the remaining basil, along with any other additional touches to taste.
