      <p class="project-description">Cary Street Partners is a wealth management company in Richmond, Virginia. As a growing organization opening new offices in different states, they wanted to organize and improve digital interactions. We worked to reorganize their content and bring a fresh voice to their new web and mobile experience.</p>
      <div class="info column col-med">
        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>Cary Street Partners approached us in 2016 to build a new web and mobile experience. We focused on unifying the voice to reflect their values for personal service. Being a smaller company compared to the big names in banking, CSP doesn't get bogged down in the business overhead.</p>

    <div class="project-body"><h3>Clear Content</h3><p class="info">This project involved organizing and pruning the content from an aging site. Extraneous language was removed to get to the core of what was important to say for the brand. Once this was complete, the new major site structure could be easily defined by the content.</p></div>

    <div class="project-body"><h3>Wireframe</h3><p class="info">Basic page sections are mocked up, further organizing our content and clarifying the focus of each page.</p></div>

    <div class="project-body"><h3>Calls to Action</h3><p class="info">Calls to Action are one of the common elements found on the end of multiple pages. Users can make up their mind during any point of their experience to take action. We can also track which page has the most impact, easily tracking engagement. </p></div>

    <div class="project-body"><h3>Mockups</h3><p class="info">Increasing the detail of the pages brings in color and type options, further clarifying the direction before moving into completed designs.</p></div>
